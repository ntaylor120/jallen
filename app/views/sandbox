Trying to get property of non-object



I have areas of my navbar that I want to limit to only those that are logged in - and that part works.

I have one area of my navbar that I don't want users to see unless they are an admin

I have a boolean in my users table called is_admin.  if it's set to 1, they are an admin.

When I tried wrapping the <li> for this particular area of the navbar, I have problems:

	@if( Auth::user()->is_admin)





here is the full view of the navbar - I haven't fleshed out the dropdown yet, as I wanted to actually get it working first:


       @if( Auth::user()->isadmin)
        <li class="dropdown">
          <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Dropdown <span class="caret"></span></a>
          <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu">
            <li><a href="#">Action</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Another action</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Something else here</a></li>
            <li class="divider"></li>
            <li><a href="#">Separated link</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
         
       @endif
