## OTHER CREDITS

I used an online service for designing a navbar with the color scheme I wanted to match my existing page:  [Twitters' Bootstrap 3 Navbar Generator] (http://twitterbootstrap3navbars.w3masters.nl/)

The code in this project is based heavily on the code demonstrated in Susan's lectures, and in sections.

I had a lot of help from many TA's via piazza - and would never have been able to get this working w/out their help.

I could not get my recipe to delete if it had reviews attached.  I finally found this:  http://laravel.io/forum/03-26-2014-delete-relationschild-relations-without-cascade, and incorporated the informaton into my code.
